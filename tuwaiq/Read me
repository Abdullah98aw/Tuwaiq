<h1> Brief </h1>
- Our idea was to create a model for data analysis and predicting future outcomes by improving the accuracy of the data. </br>
- We utilized Anaconda, specifically Spyder and Jupyter, to aid us in our project.</br>
- We employed classification_report and confusion_matrix to increase accuracy of the model.

<h1> How to operate the model </h1>
<h2> There are multiple ways, but this was my way of running the program </h2>
- go to this link https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedelnahry/diabetes-prediction/input </br>
- download data </br>
- go to colab. </br>
- upload this file early_stage_diabetes_risk_KNN_Scaler_Over_Sampler_Under_Sampler_SMOTE_SVM.ipynb </br>
- import libraries. </br>
- put your data here "df = pd.read_csv('file_path')"</br>
- run all </br>
- install "trained_model.sav" from sidebar </br>
- go to spyder and did same code in "temp.py" </br>
- go to anaconda in environment </br>
- create put it name "streamlit" </br>
- choose "Python" </br>
- version "3.8.18" </br>
- from (streamlit) "open terminal" </br>
- put this command step by step </br> 
<strong> pip install streamlit </br> pip install scikit-learn </strong> </br>
- put this command <strong> streamlit run your_script_path.py </strong>
